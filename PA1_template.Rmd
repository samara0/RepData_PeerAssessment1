```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment=NA)
```


## Loading and preprocessing the data
We first load data into a data frame `df`.
```{r}
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
head(df)
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this question, we drop rows with missing number of steps. The new data set is stored in data frame `nm.df` (non-missing df).
```{r}
nm.df <- df[!is.na(df$steps), ]
nm.df$date <- as.character(nm.df$date)
dim(nm.df)
head(nm.df)
```
Note that during the entire day of Oct 1st the data were not recorded, i.e. are missing. <br>
To find the sum of steps for each day, we use function `tapply()`. 
```{r}


dailysteps <- tapply(nm.df$steps, nm.df$date, sum)
```
For nicer printout, we convert the vector `dailysteps` into a data frame (since `tapply()` function also provided corresponding dates as `dimnames` attribute, which we utilize for the printout).
```{r}
dailysteps <- data.frame(dailysteps)
head(dailysteps, 10)

```
\newpage
Now, we plot the histogram, using `base::hist` function, with 10 breaks between the bins.

```{r, out.height='6cm', fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
png("figures/hist_num_steps_no_NA.png")
hist(dailysteps[,1], breaks = 15, main="Histogram of # Steps in a Day", xlab="steps in a day")
dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics("figures/hist_num_steps.png")
```
Finally, we compute the mean and the median of number of steps in a day.
```{r}
mean(dailysteps[,1])

median(dailysteps[,1])
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

To find average daily activity, we again use `tapply()` function.
```{r}
df$interval <- as.integer(df$interval)
avgsteps <- tapply(df$steps, df$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

head(avgsteps)
```
The following is the plot of average numer of steps in each interval.
```{r,  out.height='6cm', fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
png("figures/plot_avg_steps_no_NA.png")
plot(names(avgsteps),avgsteps,
            type='l',main="Daily Mean # Steps ",
            xlab='Interval Codes',
            ylab='Average # Steps')
dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics("figures/plot_avg_steps_no_NA.png")
```

We now find the largest average number of steps.
```{r}
max(avgsteps)
```
The interval with the maximum value is 
```{r}
which.max(avgsteps)
```
That is, it is the interval coded with the code `835`, and this is the 104th interval from the beginning of each day. Since $104\cdot 5 = 520$ min =  8:40am, the interval with the largest average number of steps is 8:40 - 8:45 am.

## Imputing missing values
The total number of missing values is obtained by
```{r}
sum(is.na(df$steps))
```

We now want to fill in these positions with mean for the corresponding interval. The values are already stored in the vector avgsteps. 
```{r}
newdf <- df
newdf$interval <- as.integer(newdf$interval)
meansrep <- rep(avgsteps, 61)
newdf$meansRep <- meansrep
newdf[is.na(newdf$steps),1] <- newdf$meansRep[is.na(newdf$steps)]
dim(newdf)
head(newdf)
```
To compute total sum for each day, we again use `tapply()` function.
```{r}
newdailysteps <- tapply(newdf$steps, newdf$date, sum)
```
We convert `newdailysteps` vector into data frame, for a nice printout.
```{r}
newdailysteps <- data.frame(newdailysteps)
head(newdailysteps)
```
Here is the new histogram
```{r}
library(knitr)
png("figures/hist_num_steps.png")
hist(newdailysteps[,1], breaks = 15, 
     main="Histogram of # Steps in a Day (Imputed)",
     xlab="steps in a day (imputed)")
dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics("figures/hist_num_steps.png")
```
The new histogram has more observations, of course, and so there is a higher frequency in some bins, but the overall shape did not change a lot. <br>

The mean for the new data set is
```{r}
mean(newdailysteps[,1])
```
and new median
```{r}
median(newdailysteps[,1])

```

Because missing values were replaced by mean values, the mean didn't change. To see this rigorously, let $m$ = number of days with non-missing values (in fact, $m=53$), $n$ = number of intervals in a day (in fact, $n=288$), and $a_{ij}$ = number of steps in the $i$-th day and in the $j$-th 5-minute interval of that day. Also, note that every missing cell is in a day where all other entries are missing (i.e. the entire days are missing a record). Without loss of generality, we may assume in first $m$ days no observation is missing, and in the remaining $k$ days all are missing (with $m+k=61$). Then, 
\begin{align}
\text{old mean} &= {1\over m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^k a_{ij} \\
\text{and} \\
\text{new mean} &= {1\over m+k} \left(\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} + k \sum_{j=1}^m \left({1\over m} \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} \right)\right)
\end{align}
Simple algebra reveals that these two expressions are the same, which explains why the two means are the same (based of our choice of filling out missing data).

The new median, however, is different, and is equal to the mean. This is not surprising, since there were a lot of missing values and all were replaced by the mean value. The overall affect was that we increased frequency of the bin where the old mean was. 

In conclusion, this does **not** seem to be the best way for imputing.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
newdf$date <- as.Date(newdf$date)
newdf$day <- weekdays(newdf$date)
newdf$dayType <- character(dim(newdf)[1])
newdf$dayType[!((newdf$day=='Saturday') | (newdf$day=='Sunday'))] <- 'weekday'
newdf$dayType[newdf$dayType==""] <- 'weekend'
```
```{r}
avgWeekdaySteps <- tapply(newdf$steps[newdf$dayType=='weekday'], 
                          newdf$interval[newdf$dayType=='weekday'], mean)

avgWeekendSteps <- tapply(newdf$steps[newdf$dayType=='weekend'], 
                          newdf$interval[newdf$dayType=='weekend'], mean)

```
Creating and saving the plot:
```{r, include = T, out.height='6cm', fig.align='center', fig.show=T}
## open jpeg file
jpeg("figures/activity_by_day_type.jpg", width = 350, height = 350)

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(names(avgWeekdaySteps),avgWeekdaySteps, 
     type='l',main="Weekdays",xlab="",ylab="# steps")
plot(names(avgWeekendSteps),avgWeekendSteps, 
     type='l',main="Weekends",xlab="Interval Code",ylab="# steps")

## close the file
dev.off()
```
```{r, out.width='75%', fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics('figures/activity_by_day_type.jpg')
``` 
We see the activity does differ, depending on whether it is a weekday or weekend. On Weekdays, it there is a lot of steps made in the morining (around 8-9am), while in the rest of the day the person makes considerably less steps. On weekends, however, the activity is higher during the entire day.
